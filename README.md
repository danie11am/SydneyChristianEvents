This is an iOS app that provides info of events organised by Chinese Christian community in Sydney. This app is available in [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/catch-chinese-christian-events/id649820279?mt=8) and can be run on devices with iOS 6.0 and above.

Event info are organised by helpers for [SCCCA](http://www.sccca.org.au) and are retrieved from a RSS feed. 

This app is not for profit and has been open-sourced as a contribution to the tech community. There are still lots to be done! If you are interested to help and contribute, please contact [myself](https://github.com/danie11am).

See [Design.md in Documentation folder](https://github.com/danie11am/SydneyChristianEvents/blob/master/Documentation/Design.md) for technical info.
